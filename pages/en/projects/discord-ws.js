              In this project, I managed to implement a Discord WebSocket
              Gateway that are used for receiving Discord events such as{" "}
              <code className={textBox}>MESSAGE_CREATE</code>,{" "}
              <code className={textBox}>VOICE_STATE_UPDATE</code>,{" "}
              <code className={textBox}>GUILD_MEMBER_ADD</code>, and more. Every
              events sent by the Discord Gateway is actually the most crucial
              feature to Discord libraries such as Discord.js, Discord.py and
              PyCord itself. Without these events received from the gateway,
              these modules will be useless, just like an empty shell. I have
              learnt a lot about WebSocket from this project and realised a
              bigger potential of this project. It shouldn&apos;t just be a
              simple Discord WebSocket project. It can be the base of many
              easy-to-use Discord libraries built by novice coders! This is why
              I recommend novices who are trying to build a new Discord library
              to use my Github project as the base of their very own Discord
              Library. Not only it will reduce the amount of work you have to do
              to create the library, it will also save you a bunch of time
              without needing you to learn and research about how to connect to
              the Discord&apos;s Gateway! This will definitely help you complete
              your dream of creating your very own Discord library as a novice
              coder in no time~ Of course if you don&apos;t like to fork the
              entire project of other people&apos;s work, you can also use my
              Github repository as reference to help you learn how to connect to
              the Discord Gateway!
